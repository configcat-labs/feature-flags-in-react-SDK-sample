# Sample application for Feature Flags using ConfigCat's new React SDK

## About

A sample application showcasing how to intergrate ConfigCat's Feature Flags using ConfigCat's new React SDK

## How it works

A demo React application with a simple feature that fetches the location of a user from the browser when the “Get Location” button is clicked. The feature is wrapped in a feature flag to conditionally render the Location tracker feature only when the associated ConfigCat feature flag is toggled on. Otherwise, render a different message.
